A collection of my personal projects in web and app development.

🎨 1. Art Arcade — PHP + MySQL Website
Art Arcade is a full-stack web platform built to empower students and local artists to showcase their artwork online. Developed using PHP, MySQL, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript, it features a responsive design, an image-based gallery system, and a database-backed upload interface.
This project was created with an inclusive business model in mind — to provide a user-friendly and accessible digital space for emerging artists to share their work without needing complex tools or expensive platforms.

Features:
Image uploads
User and artist profiles
Database-backed galleries


To Run:

Place the project in the htdocs/ folder of XAMPP
